## Course Syllabus

### Prerequisite Knowledge

Familiarity with a Unix-style command line will be important in this course.  Though we will guide you through the course. If you haven't used a Unix-style command line before, visit <a href="http://freeengineer.org/learnUNIXin10minutes.html" target="_blank">tutorial</a> with instructions to follow on your own computer. Just 10 mins cake!
* Git Bash or Cygwin on Windows.
* Terminal for OSX and Linux.

# Git installation instructions

## Installing Git

# Git Installation on Windows

## Download Git

Visit <a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io" target="_blank">this page</a> and click Download.

## Run the Downloaded File

If you are prompted to either save the file or run it, select "Run".  Otherwise, after downloading the file, double click on it to open it, and select "Run".

## Complete the Install Wizard

Continue through the install wizard, selecting the default options.

## Open Git Bash

Open the Git Bash program, which can be accessed from the Start Menu via All Programs > Git > Git Bash.  If you are using Windows 8, search for Git Bash in the app list.

## Run Git Commands
You can now use Git commands, as well as standard Unix commands, within Git Bash.  For example, try running `git --version` or `ls`.  To copy and paste in Git Bash, follow the instructions over internet.

# Git Installation on Linux

## Install Git

On Linux, open a terminal and install Git via your package manager.

For example, if you are using Ubuntu or another Debian-based distribution (eg. Ubuntu/mint), run `sudo apt-get install git`.  If you're using Fedora, run `sudo yum install git`.

## Run Git Commands

Now open a new terminal, and you will be able to run Git commands.  For example, try running `git --version`.

## Getting help on Git commands
To get information about how to use a Git command, run `git help <command>`.  For example, to get help on the command `git diff`, the first Git command you'll learn in the course, run `git help diff`.  The help pages will be in a similar format to [Unix man pages](command-line-instructions#learn-about-man-pages).
